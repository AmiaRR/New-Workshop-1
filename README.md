In workshop 1 I made a sketch using shapes and while loops, I used a youtube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLbWnCHY-io, to help me figure out how to use while loops to make bouncing shapes, I used ChatGpt to help add the squares as well as the changing colours to the background.

I also made a function using p5JS called 'drawStair,' where the lower right-hand corner of one rectangle would meets the top left hand corner of another rectangle.

I also experimented with a new shape from the documentation, which this time was a spinning circle.
