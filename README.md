For Workshop 1 I made a sketch using for and while loops, using the help of code from a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLbWnCHY-io, and a ChatGPT prompt to help add additional shapes and to make the background change colour.

In a different sketch I experimented with making a function to create a shape, though I struggled with the size and placement of this shape.

I also experimented with another shape from the p5.js documentation, which was a spinning 2D circle.
